    <p id="#p">I'm <b>Setareh</b>, and I'm a newcomer in Ottawa,the first time that I came to this city from Montreal airport, every thing was wonderful; It was

    the first month of summer, and the nature and smells reminded me of the north of my country(Iran), where in this season of the year you feel
 
    like you are in love.
    </p>
    <p>The fact is I have been here for three months with <em>my sweet daughter</em>; I am passionate to explore this city, I also decided to improve my 

    last graduation, I am excited about it and starting to learn some new things in the field of Graphic design.
