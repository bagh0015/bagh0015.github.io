    <p>I'm <b>Setareh</b>, and I'm a newcomer in Ottawa,the first time that I came to this city from Montreal airport, every thing was wonderful; It was

    the first month of summer,</br> and the nature and smells reminded me of the north of my country(Iran), where in this season of the year you feel
 
    like you are in love.
    </p>
    <p>The fact is I have been here for three months with <em>my sweet daughter</em>; I am passionate to explore this city,</br> I also decided to improve my 

    last graduation, I am excited about it and starting to learn some new things in the field of Graphic design.
